🚲 Used Bikes Market Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze the used bikes market.
The dashboard provides insights into pricing, mileage, power, ownership patterns, and geographic distribution of bikes using real-world data.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and storytelling using Power BI.

🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights

Converted text-based numeric columns (mileage, power, kms driven) into usable numeric formats

Handled range values (e.g., 45-55 kmpl) by converting them into averages

Managed mixed power units (bhp, kW, Ps) consistently

Removed inconsistencies and handled missing values professionally

📈 Business Insights

Certain cities show higher availability of used bikes

Bike prices vary significantly by location

Newer model years dominate the listings

First-owner bikes form the largest share of the market

Higher engine power generally correlates with higher price
